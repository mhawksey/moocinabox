*Plugin to capture and visualise evidence around a set of hypotheses.*

Description
----

This plugin was developed to gather and publishes evidence about the impact of open educational resources (OER). It is maintained by the [OER Research Hub project](http://oerresearchhub.org/). Here's a [Site Demo](http://sites.hawksey.info/oerhub/)

Build on [wp-plugin-template by Francis Yaconiello](https://github.com/fyaconiello/wp_plugin_template) and influenced by [Conferencer by mattdeclaire and
briankwa](http://wordpress.org/plugins/conferencer/)

The plugin has a couple of shortcodes:  
`[evidence_map]` - Overview of hub data and evidence flow  
`[evidence_geomap]` - Plot of all evidence and projects  
`[hypothesis_bar]` - Displays all the hypotheses and a summary of polarity
